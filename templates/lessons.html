						<div class="p-5 bg-light shadow rounded">
							<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
								Scales are often a piano student’s first step in learning how to
								play to the piano. While practicing scales can seem to be a
								tedious, routine exercise, scales provide the fundamentals for
								understanding music and mastering piano techniques.In general,
								it's a good idea to start with the major scales first, then move
								on to the natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor
								scales. Once you master those you can move onto things like
								chromatic scales, ​blues scales, pentatonic scales and whole
								tone scales.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="container scale-notation-box p-5 rounded" id="study">
							<h2 class="lead text-dark lesson-sub-heading">Major Scale</h2>
							<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
								Below we have a scale in C major. All major scales are layed out the same way. We have a breaksown of a tone followed by a tone then followed by a semitone then 3 more tones and a semTone and finally a tone. Major scales are made up of intervals in this order tone tone semitone, tone tone tone, seimtone. You may be asking whatis a tone and what is a semi tone. To picture what this means on a keyboard everytime you step up a note you step a semi tone. E.G. C - C# is a semitone likewise E - F is a semitone. A tone or whole tone as it is commonly reffered to is a step of two semitones. E.G of this is A - B or F# - G#. With this system you can play a major scale starting on any note. Click the play button and try this out for yourself. Come back to continue the course when you get it.

							<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
								As you played through some scales di you notice anything about the sound of the scales. Each scale has its own characteristic. As you can tell the sequence of intevals being whole tones and semi tones is the same for all major scales. So no matter where you start it all major scales sound very similar to eachother. Try and keep this sound in mind as you move onto the next section about minor scales and well compare the two to see if you notice the difference or even better can hear the difference.

						<div class="container scale-notation-box p-5 rounded">
							<h2 class="lead text-dark lesson-sub-heading">Minor Scale</h2>
							<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
								Below we have a scale in C harmonic minor. There is actually 3 minor scales. We will just focus on the harmonic minor for now and we will get into the details of the minor key in later lessons. Harmonic minor scales are made up of intervals in this order tone semitone, tone tone semitone, tone and a helf, seimtone. If you guessed that tone and a half meant three semitones then yes you would be correct. An example of thiws would be C - Eb or A - C. Click the play button and try this out for yourself. Come back to continue the course when you get it.

							<img class="me-3 scale" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/score/g/9/g9vemrj67utc3im6yrk5v6esrpdh9g4/g9vemrj6.png" style="background: #fff" alt="Note Image">
							<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
								Did you notice the difference in sound between the minor scales and the major scales. If not do not worry either have another play around with them or it will com e apparent as we develop your knowledge throuhgout the course. The sound of the the tomne and a half or the minor third as it is also commonly known as is a very distinct sound that gives the harmonic minor its unique sound. It will also become a defining charecteristic of the diminshed chords in future lessons.

								There is plenty of more scales to discover but for now I think is plenty to digest and as more details of wetern classical music get explored it will make more sense to stud these scales. Continue to play with these scales and when you are ready you can move on to lesson 3 which is all about chords.

					<div class="p-5 bg-light shadow rounded">
						<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text">
							Chord are made up of two or more Intervals. An interval is the distance between two notes. Building of of the last lesson on scales we can simply look at an interval as how many semitones are there inbetween the two notes. There is better and more practical ways of describing these intervals just like the minor third we explained earlier however we will need to lay the foundation of kys and intervals in this mnner in later lesson. Our aim in this first module is to get you playing and having fun as soon as possible.

						<p class="lead text-dark lesson-text"></p>
							Below is a diagram of many different types of chrds. Lots of which will make no sense to you right now. However, if you would like to get playing piano you might want to explore these chords in tandem with lesson 1 and just figure what the notes are the use lesson three to figure out wether the distance is. Tone a semitone or a tone and a half and if not how many semitones. I would reccomend starting with moajor chords and se if you can spot a pattern with how they are made up. moving onto minor scales as an extra chalenge. The next section of chords would be very dificult to understand and play right nw but by all means please explore them if you feel so inclined.

							Try taking everything you have learned into the challenge section of this site and see if you fluently find the notes on the keyboard that appear. Being able to do this well will send you on a fast track way to learniing the piano =much easier in the future.
