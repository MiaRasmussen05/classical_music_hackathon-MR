# Future Features 

* It would be nice to have a user profile area that saves the users current gameplay score  and a graph that tracks this over time so they can visualise their progress. 
* More lessons could be added for inclusion of different user levels. 
* The ability to show the user piano notes for a song and have the user follow along on the digital piano would be advantageous. 
* More challenges could be added to allow the user to test new skills.
